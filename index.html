<h3>About Me</h3>

<p> 
I'm a strategy consultant with 6 years experience in branding, marketing strategy and reputation management. With a start-up mind-set and approach I bring creativity, disruptive thinking and new ideas to all projects. During my time at People-Made I have worked with a diverse range of clients including luxury, banking and pharmaceutical brands. I am particularly passionate about luxury retail and technology, and how both are influencing how consumers evolve their relationships with fashion brands today.

Having previously held in-house and agency roles at Cond√© Nast, Ralph Lauren, and Omnicom, I bring a broad understand and expertise to tackle client challenges. I have a deep understanding of the importance and value of brand and from my experience I am able to deliver rigorous programmes. I consider myself a global native and have worked in and with global brands across the world, and am able to bring deep cultural understanding and experience to international projects.

I believe the best brands are authentically made and true to their word. Brands that live and breathe their promise through every interaction stand the test of time and build loyal advocates.</p>
